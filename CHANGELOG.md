### Added

- Support for opening the database in read-only mode
- Support for `Write Batch with Index` and `Write Batch Iterator`
- Support for `Range Compaction` operations
- Nullability annotations
	- Better compatibility with Swift
- New statistics and counters
- Cocoapods Podspec
- Travis integration

### Breaking Changes

- RocksDB initializers were changed to class instead of instance methods
- Removed RocksDB methods without error parameter
	- Better compatibility with Swift's error-handling model
- Refactored all RocksDB methods so that the error parameter is the last
	- Better compatibility with Swift's error-handling model
- Removed `Column Family Metadata` from iOS target
- `RocksDBIteratorKeyRange` is refactored to `RocksDBKeyRange`
	- Key ranges are used not only for iterations but also for compaction jobs
	- Empty-range constant is refactored to open-range, since it represents a range containing all the keys
- ObjectiveRocks builds frameworks now instead of static libraries
